Technologies Used
1. Python
Core Language: Python will be the primary language for developing the desktop agent application.
Libraries:
pyautogui: For capturing screenshots.
pynput: For monitoring keyboard and mouse activity.
asyncio: For handling asynchronous tasks like periodic screenshot capture and data uploads.
requests: For sending HTTP requests to upload data to cloud services.
pymongo: For interaction with MongoDB if local storage is required before upload.
PIL (Pillow): For image processing tasks like blurring screenshots.
watchdog: For monitoring file system changes or configuration updates.
2. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Amazon S3: For storing and managing uploaded screenshots and activity logs.
AWS Lambda: For handling the backend processing of uploads, such as file storage or data transformation.
AWS IAM: For managing permissions and roles required for secure interaction with S3 and Lambda.
Boto3: AWS SDK for Python to interact with S3 for uploading files.
3. FastAPI
Used for creating an API that handles configuration updates from a web application, allowing the agent to fetch new configurations (e.g., interval times, screenshot settings).
4. MongoDB
A NoSQL database used for temporarily storing captured data locally (e.g., activity logs and screenshots) before uploading to cloud storage.
5. React.js
For the front-end of the web application where users can configure the agent settings (e.g., screenshot intervals, whether screenshots should be blurred, etc.).
6. Encryption & Security
PyCryptodome: A library for implementing encryption to ensure that data is securely uploaded to S3.
7. System-level Tools
Time Zone Management: Utilizing Python's tzlocal or pytz libraries for detecting and managing time zone changes.
8. Testing and Debugging Tools
Pytest: For unit testing the different components of the application.
Logging: Using Python's logging module for error handling, activity tracking, and debugging.
9. Deployment & Packaging
PyInstaller: To package the Python script as a standalone executable that can run on users' desktops without requiring them to install Python.
10. Error Handling
Retry Mechanisms: For retrying failed uploads due to connectivity issues.
Queueing: To handle data that couldnâ€™t be uploaded immediately, ensuring it's uploaded once the network is restored.
